* Here is a basic outline on opening issues and making PRs:


 ##  Opening Issues

* Feel free to use GitHub issues for questions, bug reports, and feature requests.
* Search for your problem in the [issues section](https://github.com/dscbvppune/dsc/issues) before opening a new ticket. It might be already answered and save both you and us time. 😄

* Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.

## Making Pull Requests
