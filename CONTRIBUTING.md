# Contributing

* First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to dsc.
* Here is a basic outline on opening issues and making PRs:


 ##  Opening Issues

               This section guides you through submitting a bug report for dsc. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻 💻, and find related reports.

* Feel free to use GitHub issues for questions, bug reports, and feature requests.
* Search for your problem in the issues section before opening a new ticket. It might be already answered and save both you and me time. 😄
* Provide as much information as possible when opening your ticket, including any relevant links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets.
* Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* If you think your question is naive or something and you can't find anything related, don't feel bad. Open an issue any way!

## Making Pull Requests
    
* Look up for open issues and see if you can help out there.
* When making a PR, point it to the master branch unless mentioned otherwise.
* If you are planning to work on something big, let me know through an issue. So we can discuss more about it.
* Lastly, please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions! Let us know (through an issue) if you are facing any trouble making a PR, we’d be glad to help you out!
